# Bank_Loan_Data_analysis
this project aims to uncover patterns that indicate whether a customer is likely to face difficulties in repaying their loan installments. This analysis will help the company make informed decisions, including approving loans for capable applicants, reducing loan amounts, or adjusting interest rates for riskier applicants.
